python-socket-chat
==================

A super basic chat room in python using the low level socket library. Run chat_server.py then run as many instances of the client as desired. Currently only works between instances run on the localhost or over the same network.

<code>python chat_server.py</code> <br>
<code>python chat_client.py localhost 8000</code>
