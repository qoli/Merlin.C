                 * Regression testing for HAProxy with VTest *


This little README file is about how to compile and run vtest test case files (VTC files)
to test HAProxy for any regression.

To do so, you will have to compile vtest program sources which depends on
Varnish cache application sources. vtest, formerly varnishtest, is a very useful
program which has been developed to test Varnish cache application. vtest has been
modified in collaboration with Varnish cache conceptor Poul-Henning Kamp to support
HAProxy in addition to Varnish cache.

See also: doc/regression-testing.txt

* vtest compilation *

    $ git clone https://github.com/vtest/VTest

    $ cd VTest

    $ make vtest

  Then vtest program may be found at the root directory of vtest sources directory.
  The Varnish cache manuals are located in 'man' directory of Varnish cache sources
  directory. You will have to have a look at varnishtest(7) and vtc(7) manuals to
  use vtest.

  Some information may also be found in doc/regression-testing.txt in HAProxy
  sources.

  Note that VTC files for Varnish cache may be found in bin/varnishtest/tests directory
  of Varnish cache sources directory which may be found here:
  https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache


* vtest execution *

  You must set HAPROXY_PROGRAM environment variable to give the location
  of the HAProxy program to test to vtest:

    $ HAPROXY_PROGRAM=<my haproxy program> vtest [-Dno-htx=] ...

  The HAProxy VTC files found in HAProxy sources may be run with the reg-tests
  Makefile target. You must set the VTEST_PROGRAM environment variable to
  give the location of the vtest program which has been previously compiled.

    $ VTEST_PROGRAM=<my vtest program> make reg-tests

  "reg-tests" Makefile target run scripts/run-regtest.sh script.
  To get more information about this script run it with --help option.

  Note that vtest is run with -t10 and -l option. -l option is to keep
  keep vtest temporary directory in case of failed test cases. core files
  may be found in this directory (if enabled by ulimit).


* vtest patches for HAProxy VTC files *

  When producing a patch to add a VTC regression testing file to reg-tests directory,
  please follow these simple rules:

    - If your VTC file needs others files, if possible, use the same basename as that
      of the VTC file,
    - Put these files in a directory with the same name as the code area concerned
      by the bug ('peers', 'lua', 'acl' etc).
