/* While the functions above report average event counts per period, we are
 * also interested in average values per event. For this we use a different
 * method. The principle is to rely on a long tail which sums the new value
 * with a fraction of the previous value, resulting in a sliding window of
 * infinite length depending on the precision we're interested in.
 *
 * The idea is that we always keep (N-1)/N of the sum and add the new sampled
 * value. The sum over N values can be computed with a simple program for a
 * constant value 1 at each iteration :
 *
 *     N
 *   ,---
 *    \       N - 1              e - 1
 *     >  ( --------- )^x ~= N * -----
 *    /         N                  e
 *   '---
 *   x = 1
 *
 * Note: I'm not sure how to demonstrate this but at least this is easily
 * verified with a simple program, the sum equals N * 0.632120 for any N
 * moderately large (tens to hundreds).
 *
 * Inserting a constant sample value V here simply results in :
 *
 *    sum = V * N * (e - 1) / e
 *
 * But we don't want to integrate over a small period, but infinitely. Let's
 * cut the infinity in P periods of N values. Each period M is exactly the same
 * as period M-1 with a factor of ((N-1)/N)^N applied. A test shows that given a
 * large N :
 *
 *      N - 1           1
 *   ( ------- )^N ~=  ---
 *        N             e
 *
 * Our sum is now a sum of each factor times  :
 *
 *    N*P                                     P
 *   ,---                                   ,---
 *    \         N - 1               e - 1    \     1
 *     >  v ( --------- )^x ~= VN * -----  *  >   ---
 *    /           N                   e      /    e^x
 *   '---                                   '---
 *   x = 1                                  x = 0
 *
 * For P "large enough", in tests we get this :
 *
 *    P
 *  ,---
 *   \     1        e
 *    >   --- ~=  -----
 *   /    e^x     e - 1
 *  '---
 *  x = 0
 *
 * This simplifies the sum above :
 *
 *    N*P
 *   ,---
 *    \         N - 1
 *     >  v ( --------- )^x = VN
 *    /           N
 *   '---
 *   x = 1
 *
 * So basically by summing values and applying the last result an (N-1)/N factor
 * we just get N times the values over the long term, so we can recover the
 * constant value V by dividing by N. In order to limit the impact of integer
 * overflows, we'll use this equivalence which saves us one multiply :
 *
 *               N - 1                   1             x0
 *    x1 = x0 * -------   =  x0 * ( 1 - --- )  = x0 - ----
 *                 N                     N              N
 *
 * And given that x0 is discrete here we'll have to saturate the values before
 * performing the divide, so the value insertion will become :
 *
 *               x0 + N - 1
 *    x1 = x0 - ------------
 *                    N
 *
 * A value added at the entry of the sliding window of N values will thus be
 * reduced to 1/e or 36.7% after N terms have been added. After a second batch,
 * it will only be 1/e^2, or 13.5%, and so on. So practically speaking, each
 * old period of N values represents only a quickly fading ratio of the global
 * sum :
 *
 *   period    ratio
 *     1       36.7%
 *     2       13.5%
 *     3       4.98%
 *     4       1.83%
 *     5       0.67%
 *     6       0.25%
 *     7       0.09%
 *     8       0.033%
 *     9       0.012%
 *    10       0.0045%
 *
 * So after 10N samples, the initial value has already faded out by a factor of
 * 22026, which is quite fast. If the sliding window is 1024 samples wide, it
 * means that a sample will only count for 1/22k of its initial value after 10k
 * samples went after it, which results in half of the value it would represent
 * using an arithmetic mean. The benefit of this method is that it's very cheap
 * in terms of computations when N is a power of two. This is very well suited
 * to record response times as large values will fade out faster than with an
 * arithmetic mean and will depend on sample count and not time.
 *
 * Demonstrating all the above assumptions with maths instead of a program is
 * left as an exercise for the reader.

 * is only an approximate. Indeed, as can be seen with two samples only over a
 * 8-sample window, the original function would return :
 *  sum1 = sum  - (sum + 7) / 8 + v
 *  sum2 = sum1 - (sum1 + 7) / 8 + v
 *       = (sum - (sum + 7) / 8 + v) - (sum - (sum + 7) / 8 + v + 7) / 8 + v

 *      ~= (3sum/4 + sum/64) - (7/4 + 7/64) + 15v/8
 *
 * while the function below would return :
 *  sum  = sum + 2*v - (sum + 8) * 2 / 8
 *       = 3sum/4 + 2v - 2
 *
 * this presents an error of ~ (sum/64 + 9/64 + v/8) = (sum+n+1)/(n^s) + v/n
 *
 * Thus the simplified function effectively replaces a part of the history with
 * a linear sum instead of applying the exponential one. But as long as s/n is
 * "small enough", the error fades away and remains small for both small and
 * large values of n and s (typically < 0.2% measured).
