 * caller must be careful about how operations are run as it will definitely
 * happen that the element being enqueued is processed by the other thread
 * before the call returns. Some locking conventions between the caller and the
 * callee might sometimes be necessary. The task is always woken up with reason
 * TASK_WOKEN_OTHER and a context pointing to the work_list entry.
